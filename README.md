# Bus Schedule
The app presents a list of bus stops and arrival times from earliest to latest. Tapping on a row in the first screen leads to a new screen showing only the upcoming arrival times for the selected bus stop.  
- __Room__ is integrated to display the prepopulated database of arrival times.
- __SQL__ commands are performed on the database to access the data.
- Finally, __Flow__ is used to respond to data changes.
